# Teams Messages Not Being Deleted After Retention Period

## Symptoms

- **Messages remain visible beyond retention period:** A "delete-only" or "retain then delete" retention policy targets Teams, but messages are still visible to users past the expected expiration.
- **Admin expectation vs. user report:** Admin expects messages to be deleted based on policy configuration, but users report messages are still visible — may be within the normal 16-day async processing window.
- **Channel messages not deleting:** Messages in standard or private channels are not being deleted — different from chat messages, channel messages are stored in the team's group mailbox.
- **Chat messages not deleting:** 1:1 or group chat messages remain visible — stored in user mailboxes, subject to different hold/policy evaluation.
- **Shared channel messages not covered:** Shared channel messages are not being retained or deleted — the parent team may not be included in the `Teams channel messages` retention policy.
- **User-deleted messages still discoverable after 21+ days:** A user deletes a Teams message, but it remains recoverable for 21 days before entering `SubstrateHolds` — this is by design.
- **"When Last Modified" setting appears to be ignored:** Policy configured with "When items were last modified" but retention operates on creation date — known Teams behavior.

## Data Collection

Execute all commands below to gather the complete diagnostic dataset. Replace `<PolicyName>` with the policy name and `<UPN>` with the affected user.

### 1.1 Policy Configuration & Status

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" | FL TeamsChannelLocation, TeamsChatLocation, Enabled, DistributionStatus
Get-RetentionComplianceRule -Policy "<PolicyName>" | FL RetentionDuration, RetentionComplianceAction
```

### 1.2 SubstrateHolds Content

```powershell
Get-MailboxFolderStatistics <UPN> -FolderScope RecoverableItems | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "SubstrateHolds"} | FL FolderSize, ItemsInFolder
```

### 1.3 Holds on User Mailbox

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <UPN> | FL InPlaceHolds, LitigationHoldEnabled, ComplianceTagHoldApplied
```

### 1.4 Private Channel Migration Status

```powershell
# Post-2025 migration: private channel messages move from user mailboxes to group mailboxes
Get-Mailbox -GroupMailbox | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*<TeamName>*"} | FL DisplayName, ExchangeGuid, WhenCreated
```

### 1.5 Shared/Private Channel Coverage

```powershell
Get-UnifiedGroup -Identity "<TeamName>" | FL InPlaceHolds
Get-Mailbox -GroupMailbox | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*<TeamName>*"} | FL InPlaceHolds
```

## Diagnostic Analysis

### Expected Deletion Timeline

Teams message deletion follows a multi-step async process:

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Retention period expires | As configured | Timer starts from message creation/modification |
| MFA processes the mailbox | Up to **7 days** | SubstrateHolds copy marked for deletion |
| TBA cleanup runs | Up to **7 days** | Backend removes the substrate copy |
| Teams client cache refresh | Up to **2 days** | Message disappears from Teams UI |
| **Total maximum lag** | **Up to 16 days** | After retention period expiry |

### Diagnostic Checklist

Analyze the collected data against the following criteria. Flag each as ✅ (healthy) or ❌ (issue found).

| # | Check | Condition for ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Policy targets Teams** | Both `TeamsChannelLocation` and `TeamsChatLocation` are empty |
| 2 | **Distribution status** | `DistributionStatus` ≠ Success → switch to [Policy Stuck in Error](policy-stuck-error.md) |
| 3 | **Within 16-day lag** | Message age < retention period + 16 days — still within expected async window |
| 4 | **Litigation hold** | `LitigationHoldEnabled` = True — overrides retention deletion |
| 5 | **Competing longer retain policy** | Another retention policy with longer retain period exists — longest wins |
| 6 | **Compliance tag hold** | `ComplianceTagHoldApplied` = True — retention label with "retain" overrides delete-only policies |
| 7 | **Shared channel coverage** | Retention policy doesn't include the Team's group mailbox — shared channel messages not covered |
| 8 | **Private channel migration conflict** | Post-2025 migration: existing `Teams private channel messages` policies may conflict with `Teams channel messages` policies applied to the same parent team. Both policies enforce but may overlap |

---

## Resolution & Remediation

Based on flagged issues from the diagnostic report, apply the corresponding resolution:

| ❌ Check | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Policy doesn't target Teams | Update policy to include `TeamsChannelLocation` and/or `TeamsChatLocation` |
| 2 | Distribution failure | Switch to [Policy Stuck in Error](policy-stuck-error.md) TSG |
| 3 | Normal async processing | Wait up to 16 days past retention expiry — no action needed |
| 4 | Litigation hold overriding deletion | Remove litigation hold if no longer required |
| 5 | Longer competing retention policy | Remove or shorten competing policy; see [Principles of Retention](mrm-purview-conflict.md) |
| 6 | Retention label overriding deletion | Remove or modify the applied compliance tag |
| 7 | Shared/private channels not covered | Include M365 Groups in policy scope to cover shared channel messages |
| 8 | Private channel migration policy conflict | Post-2025: create new `Teams channel messages` policies for parent teams with private channels. Old `Teams private channel messages` policies continue to work but can't be edited post-migration. Remove overlapping policies to prevent confusion |

## Additional Scenarios

### Shared Channel Messages — Retention Policy Not Applying (#21a)

Shared channels **inherit retention settings from the parent team**. Messages are stored in `SubstrateGroup` mailboxes (not standard `GroupMailbox`). If the parent team is not included in a `Teams channel messages` retention policy, shared channel messages will not be covered.

**Key points:**
- Shared channels cannot be targeted independently — they always follow the parent team.
- For org-wide policies ("All" teams selected), shared channels are automatically included.
- If using specific inclusions, add the **parent team** — not the shared channel itself.

**Detection:**
```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" | FL TeamsChannelLocation
# Verify the parent team is listed
```

### User-Deleted Messages — 21-Day Delay (#21c)

When a user deletes a Teams message, the message **disappears from the Teams app** but does NOT go into the `SubstrateHolds` folder for **21 days**. This is by design — the 21-day delay allows for potential message recovery via the Teams client.

**Timeline for user-deleted messages:**
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Message deleted by user — hidden from Teams UI | Immediate |
| Message enters SubstrateHolds | After **21 days** |
| SubstrateHolds retention (minimum) | **1 day** |
| Timer job purge | **1–7 days** |
| **Total: user deletion to permanent deletion** | **Up to 29 days** |

**Note:** This is different from admin-initiated retention deletion (which follows the standard 16-day timeline). eDiscovery can still find user-deleted messages during the 21-day window.

### "When Last Modified" Setting Ignored for Teams (#21d)

Although the Purview portal allows selecting "Start the retention period based on: When items were last modified," the value of **"When items were created"** is always used for Teams messages. This is a **known configuration issue** documented by Microsoft.

For edited messages, a copy of the original is saved with the original timestamp, and the post-edited message gets a newer timestamp.

**Resolution:** This is by design. Inform stakeholders that Teams retention always operates on **creation date**, regardless of the UI selection. Plan retention periods accordingly.
