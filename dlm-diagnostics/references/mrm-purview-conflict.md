# MRM and Purview Retention Conflict — Unexpected Deletion or Retention

## Symptoms

- **Items unexpectedly deleted:** MRM delete tag is deleting content that a Purview retention policy should be retaining — admin expected Purview to override MRM deletion.
- **Items unexpectedly retained:** Purview hold is preventing MRM cleanup — items remain in the mailbox past the MRM tag's configured retention period.
- **Confusion about precedence:** Admin is unsure which system (MRM vs. Purview) takes priority and how they interact on the same mailbox.
- **Default MRM Policy not assigned to new mailboxes:** New mailboxes are not getting the Default MRM Policy automatically — provisioning scripts or templates may be overriding the default assignment.
- **RPT (Retention Policy Tag) not processing default folders:** An RPT assigned to Inbox, Sent Items, or Deleted Items is not being applied — may be a duplicate RPT or unsupported action type.
- **NeverDelete tag cannot be removed:** Admin attempts to delete the `NeverDelete` retention tag but it keeps reappearing — this is a system tag that is automatically recreated.

## Data Collection

Execute all commands below to gather the complete diagnostic dataset. Replace `<UPN>` with the affected user's email address.

### 1.1 All Active Retention Mechanisms on Mailbox

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <UPN> | FL RetentionPolicy, RetentionHoldEnabled, InPlaceHolds, LitigationHoldEnabled, ComplianceTagHoldApplied
```

### 1.2 MRM Tags and Actions

```powershell
$policy = (Get-Mailbox <UPN>).RetentionPolicy
Get-RetentionPolicy $policy | Select -ExpandProperty RetentionPolicyTagLinks
Get-RetentionPolicyTag | Where-Object {$_.RetentionAction -ne "MoveToArchive"} | FL Name, Type, AgeLimitForRetention, RetentionAction, RetentionEnabled
```

### 1.3 Purview Retention Policies Affecting Mailbox

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy | Where-Object {$_.ExchangeLocation -eq "All" -or $_.ExchangeLocation -contains "<UPN>"} | FL Name, Guid
```

```powershell
# For each policy found above:
Get-RetentionComplianceRule -Policy "<PolicyName>" | FL RetentionDuration, RetentionComplianceAction
```

### 1.4 Recoverable Items (Current State)

```powershell
Get-MailboxFolderStatistics <UPN> -FolderScope RecoverableItems | FL Name, ItemsInFolder, FolderSize
```

### 1.5 TracingFAI Errors

```powershell
$tracingFai = Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs <UPN> -ComponentName TracingFai
$faiData = $tracingFai.MailboxLog | ConvertFrom-Json

$faiData | Where-Object {$_.Fs.Count -ne 0} | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Errors in folder: $($_.P)" -ForegroundColor Red
    $_.Fs | Group-Object -Property F | ForEach-Object {
        switch ($_.Name) {
            1 { "DumpsterQuotaTooSmall" }
            2 { "RecipientCorrupt" }

            8 { "CorruptRecipients" }
            9 { "CorruptComplianceEntry" }
            10 { "ResetComplianceEntry" }
            11 { "FolderItemCountLimit" }
        }
    }
}
```

### 1.6 FAI Tag Consistency (FAI vs. Policy)

```powershell
$config = Test-ArchiveConnectivity <UPN> -IncludeArchiveMRMConfiguration

# Tags stamped on mailbox (FAI)
$policyTags = ([xml]$config.PrimaryMRMConfiguration).UserConfiguration.Info.Data.PolicyTag
$archiveTags = ([xml]$config.PrimaryMRMConfiguration).UserConfiguration.Info.Data.ArchiveTag

# Tags defined in assigned retention policy
$mbx = Get-Mailbox <UPN>
$policyLinks = (Get-RetentionPolicy $mbx.RetentionPolicy).RetentionPolicyTagLinks
$definedTags = Get-RetentionPolicyTag | Where-Object {$_.Identity -in $policyLinks}

$definedTags | Format-Table Name, RetentionAction, AgeLimitForRetention, Type
$policyTags | Format-Table Name, Guid, IsVisible, Type
```

## Diagnostic Analysis

### Principles of Retention (Precedence Rules)

| Priority | Principle |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Retention wins over deletion.** If any policy says "retain," the item is kept regardless of delete policies. |
| 2 | **Longest retention period wins.** If multiple retain policies apply, the longest duration governs. |
| 3 | **Explicit inclusion wins over implicit.** A policy targeting a specific user overrides an org-wide policy. |
| 4 | **Shortest deletion period wins.** If only delete policies apply (no retain), the shortest delete period fires first. |

**MRM vs. Purview interaction:** MRM can delete items from user's visible mailbox, but if a Purview hold exists, deleted items are **preserved in Recoverable Items**. MRM deletion from user view ≠ permanent deletion when Purview holds exist.

### Diagnostic Checklist

Analyze the collected data against the following criteria. Flag each as ✅ (healthy) or ❌ (issue found).

| # | Check | Condition for ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **MRM delete + no Purview retain** | MRM delete tag active AND no Purview retain policy covering the mailbox — items permanently deleted after RI period |
| 2 | **MRM delete + Purview retain** | Items deleted from user view but preserved in RI — **expected behavior**, not an issue unless user reports missing items |
| 3 | **Old MRM policy post-migration** | MRM policy still assigned after org migrated to Purview |
| 4 | **Multiple conflicting Purview policies** | Multiple policies with different retain/delete durations — precedence rules creating unexpected outcomes |
| 5 | **TracingFAI errors** | Non-zero `Fs` entries (TagUnexpectedActionChanged, CorruptComplianceEntry, RecipientCorrupt, etc.) |
| 6 | **FAI tag mismatch** | FAI tags don't match `RetentionPolicyTagLinks` — stale/corrupt MRM config |

---

## Resolution & Remediation

Based on flagged issues from the diagnostic report, apply the corresponding resolution:

| ❌ Check | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | MRM deleting without compliance safety net | Apply a Purview retain policy immediately; recover content from RI via Content Search/eDiscovery if within RI retention (14 days default) |
| 2 | Expected behavior — user perceives deletion | Communicate: items are preserved in RI by Purview hold; use eDiscovery to surface if needed |
| 3 | Legacy MRM not cleaned up | Remove MRM policy: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -RetentionPolicy $null`; or disable specific delete tags: `Set-RetentionPolicyTag "<TagName>" -RetentionEnabled $false` |
| 4 | Conflicting Purview policies | Consolidate policies; apply Principles of Retention to predict outcomes |
| 5 | Corrupted MRM processing state | `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -RemoveMRMConfiguration` then `Start-ManagedFolderAssistant <UPN>` |
| 6 | Stale FAI configuration | `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -RemoveMRMConfiguration` then `Start-ManagedFolderAssistant <UPN>` |

**General recommendation:** Migrate fully to Purview retention policies and deprecate MRM delete/retain tags.

## Additional Scenarios

### Default MRM Policy Not Assigned to New Mailboxes (#18b)

In Exchange Online, the **Default MRM Policy** is automatically assigned to all new mailboxes. However, if a custom retention policy is assigned at creation time (via provisioning scripts, templates, or MailboxPlan), the default is overridden. Additionally, the Default MRM Policy moves items to archive only if an **archive mailbox is enabled** — if no archive exists, the MoveToArchive action is silently skipped.

**Detection:**
```powershell
Get-Mailbox <UPN> | FL RetentionPolicy, ArchiveStatus
# RetentionPolicy should be "Default MRM Policy" (or a custom MRM policy with archive tags)
# ArchiveStatus should be "Active" for archive tags to function
```

**Resolution:**
1. Assign the Default MRM Policy: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -RetentionPolicy "Default MRM Policy"`
2. Enable archive if missing: `Enable-Mailbox <UPN> -Archive`
3. Check MailboxPlan if new mailboxes consistently miss the default policy:
   ```powershell
   Get-MailboxPlan | FL DisplayName, RetentionPolicy
   ```

### RPT (Retention Policy Tag) Not Processing Default Folders (#18c)

Retention Policy Tags (RPTs) apply to specific default folders (Inbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, etc.). Key limitations:

1. **One RPT per default folder:** If multiple RPTs for the same folder type are linked to a retention policy, only the first is applied.
2. **Supported actions only:** RPTs support only `DeleteAndAllowRecovery` or `PermanentlyDelete` — NOT `MoveToArchive`.
3. **Users cannot change RPTs:** Unlike personal tags, users cannot override or change RPTs applied to default folders.

**Detection:**
```powershell
# Check for duplicate RPTs for the same folder type
$policy = (Get-Mailbox <UPN>).RetentionPolicy
Get-RetentionPolicy $policy | Select -ExpandProperty RetentionPolicyTagLinks | ForEach-Object {
    Get-RetentionPolicyTag $_ | Where-Object {$_.Type -ne "All" -and $_.Type -ne "Personal"} | FL Name, Type, RetentionAction, RetentionEnabled
}
```

### NeverDelete System Tag Cannot Be Removed (#18i)

The `NeverDelete` retention tag is a **system tag** created automatically by Exchange Online. It **cannot be permanently removed** from the tenant — if deleted, it will be automatically recreated.

**Resolution:** This is by design. Do not attempt to delete this tag. If you need to restrict user access, use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to control which personal tags users can opt-in to.

### Recoverable Items Growing in Hybrid/Hold Scenario (#18g)

In hybrid environments, when a retention hold is configured in Microsoft 365, the hold GUID is written to the `msExchUserHoldPolicies` attribute and synced back to on-premises AD. The on-premises MFA finds the hold attribute but **cannot retrieve the hold details** (they exist only in Exchange Online), so it skips purging items from `DiscoveryHolds`, causing indefinite growth.

**Detection:**
```powershell
Get-MailboxFolderStatistics <UPN> -FolderScope RecoverableItems | FL Name, ItemsInFolder, FolderSize
```

**Resolution:** Follow the steps in [Recoverable Items folder not emptied for mailbox on litigation or retention hold](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/exchange/antispam-and-protection/recoverable-items-folder-full).
