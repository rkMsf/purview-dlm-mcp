# Inactive Mailbox Not Created After User Deletion

## Symptoms

- **Mailbox permanently deleted instead of becoming inactive:** A user was deleted from Entra ID, but the mailbox was permanently purged after 30 days instead of converting to an inactive mailbox — no hold was applied before deletion.
- **Soft-deleted mailbox approaching 30-day window:** Mailbox is in soft-deleted state and the 30-day recovery window is expiring — urgent action needed to apply a hold before permanent deletion.
- **Cannot recover inactive mailbox with auto-expanding archive:** Recovery or restore operation fails because the inactive mailbox has auto-expanding archive enabled — `New-Mailbox -InactiveMailbox` and `New-MailboxRestoreRequest` are not supported.
- **Cannot delete inactive mailbox — multiple holds:** Admin wants to permanently delete an inactive mailbox but multiple holds (retention policies, Litigation Hold, eDiscovery) prevent removal.
- **Inactive mailbox has same SMTP as active mailbox:** Two mailboxes share the same primary SMTP address (active user + inactive mailbox), causing ambiguity in PowerShell commands and policy operations.
- **UPN/SMTP changed before deletion:** Admin changed the UPN or primary SMTP address before deleting the user, making the inactive mailbox unmanageable via the original policy reference.

## Data Collection

Execute all commands below to gather the complete diagnostic dataset. Replace `<UPN>` with the affected user's email address.

### 1.1 Check Inactive Mailbox Status

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -Identity <UPN> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | FL UserPrincipalName, IsInactiveMailbox, InPlaceHolds, LitigationHoldEnabled
```

### 1.2 Check Soft-Deleted Mailbox Status

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox -Identity <UPN> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | FL UserPrincipalName, WhenSoftDeleted, InPlaceHolds, LitigationHoldEnabled
```

### 1.3 Soft-Deleted Mailbox Recovery Window

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox | Where-Object {$_.UserPrincipalName -eq "<UPN>"} | FL UserPrincipalName, WhenSoftDeleted, ExchangeGuid, ArchiveGuid
```

### 1.4 Retention Policies Covering Exchange

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy | FL Name, ExchangeLocation, Enabled, Mode
```

## Diagnostic Analysis

Analyze the collected data against the following criteria. Flag each as ✅ (healthy) or ❌ (issue found).

| # | Check | Condition for ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Inactive mailbox exists** | No results from `Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly` |
| 2 | **Soft-deleted mailbox exists** | No results from `Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox` (permanently purged) |
| 3 | **Soft-delete within 30-day window** | `WhenSoftDeleted` > 30 days ago (recovery window expired) |
| 4 | **Hold/retention at time of deletion** | No `InPlaceHolds`, `LitigationHoldEnabled` = False on soft-deleted mailbox |
| 5 | **Retention policy coverage** | No retention policy with `ExchangeLocation` covering the user, or policy `Enabled` = False / `Mode` = PendingDeletion |

---

## Resolution & Remediation

Based on flagged issues from the diagnostic report, apply the corresponding resolution:

| ❌ Check | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (but 2 ✅) | Mailbox soft-deleted, not yet inactive — hold was missing | **Within 30 days:** Restore user in Entra ID → apply hold → re-delete. Or: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -LitigationHoldEnabled $true -InactiveMailbox` |
| 1 and 2 | Mailbox permanently purged (past 30-day window) | **Data loss — no recovery possible** |
| 4 | No hold/retention policy on mailbox at deletion time | Root cause confirmed — mailbox deleted without compliance hold |
| 5 | Policy existed but was disabled or pending deletion | Policy was not effectively applied at time of deletion |

**Recovery Procedures (within 30-day window):**

1. **Restore user in Entra ID** → apply hold → re-delete user (mailbox becomes inactive)
2. **Restore mailbox content:** `New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox <ExchangeGuid> -TargetMailbox <TargetUPN> -AllowLegacyDNMismatch`
3. **Undo soft-delete (if applicable):** `Undo-SoftDeletedMailbox -SoftDeletedObject <ExchangeGuid>` (requires reconnecting with a new user account)

---

## Prevention Checklist

1. Ensure **all mailboxes** are covered by an org-wide retention policy with "retain" action **before** user deletion
2. Verify policy distribution: `Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<name>" -DistributionDetail`
3. Check hold stamp on mailbox before user deletion: `Get-Mailbox <UPN> | FL InPlaceHolds, LitigationHoldEnabled`

## Additional Scenarios

### Recovery with Auto-Expanding Archive (#17b)

Inactive mailboxes configured with auto-expanding archive **cannot** be recovered or restored using `New-Mailbox -InactiveMailbox` or `New-MailboxRestoreRequest`. This is a known platform limitation.

**Detection:**
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -Identity <UPN> | FL AutoExpandingArchiveEnabled
```

**Resolution:** If `AutoExpandingArchiveEnabled` is True, the only supported recovery method is **Content Search** (eDiscovery) to export data from the inactive mailbox. Use the Purview portal → eDiscovery → Content Search to create a search targeting the inactive mailbox, then export the results.

### Multiple Holds Blocking Deletion (#17d)

An inactive mailbox can have multiple holds applied simultaneously: org-wide retention policies, specific-inclusion policies, retention labels, eDiscovery holds, Litigation Hold, and legacy In-Place Holds. **All** holds must be removed before the mailbox transitions to soft-deleted and is permanently deleted after 30 days.

**Detection:**
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -Identity <UPN> | FL Name, ExchangeGuid, LitigationHoldEnabled, InPlaceHolds, ComplianceTagHoldApplied
```

**Resolution steps:**
1. Remove Litigation Hold: `Set-Mailbox -InactiveMailbox -Identity <UPN> -LitigationHoldEnabled $false`
2. Exclude from org-wide holds: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -ExcludeFromAllOrgHolds`
3. Remove from specific-inclusion policies: `Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyGUID>" -RemoveExchangeLocation <UPN>`
4. Remove legacy In-Place Holds: `Invoke-HoldRemovalAction -Action RemoveHold -ExchangeLocation <UPN> -HoldId <holdID>`
5. Force recalculation: `Set-Mailbox -Identity <UPN> -RecalculateInactiveMailbox`

**Note:** If a retention policy uses **Preservation Lock**, the inactive mailbox **cannot** be removed from that policy — contact Microsoft Support.

### Same SMTP Address as Active Mailbox (#17e)

When a new user is created with the same email address as a former employee whose mailbox was made inactive, both mailboxes share the SMTP address. This causes ambiguity in `Get-Mailbox`, policy targeting, and administrative operations.

**Resolution:** Use `DistinguishedName` or `ExchangeGuid` to uniquely identify the inactive mailbox:
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -ResultSize Unlimited | Select DisplayName, PrimarySmtpAddress, DistinguishedName, ExchangeGuid
Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -Identity <ExchangeGuid>
```

### UPN/SMTP Change Before Deletion (#17f)

If a UPN or primary SMTP address is changed **before** the user account is deleted, the inactive mailbox cannot be removed from the retention policy because the identity no longer matches what the policy recorded.

**Resolution:** This is a **preventive** scenario — do NOT change UPN/SMTP before making a mailbox inactive. If already in this state, contact Microsoft Support for backend operations.
4. Consider Litigation Hold as a safety net for high-value mailboxes: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -LitigationHoldEnabled $true`
