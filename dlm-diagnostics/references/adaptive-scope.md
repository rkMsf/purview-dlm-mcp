# Adaptive Scope Issues

## Symptoms

- **Wrong members in scope:** Adaptive scope includes users, groups, or sites that should not be targeted — often caused by an OPATH filter matching unintended recipients.
- **No members in scope:** Scope shows 0 members in the portal or `Get-Recipient -Filter` returns no results — filter query is invalid or too restrictive.
- **Scope shows members in portal but policy still failing:** Membership appears correct in the scope details page, but the associated retention policy is not applying to those locations.
- **Scope populating slowly:** Scope was recently created and membership count is still increasing — adaptive scopes require at least 5 days to fully populate.
- **Inflated member count:** Scope count is significantly higher than expected — unlicensed, synced, or non-mailbox accounts are being included.
- **Cannot use with trainable classifiers:** Auto-apply policy using a trainable classifier fails when combined with an adaptive scope — this combination is not supported.

## Data Collection

Execute all commands below to gather the complete diagnostic dataset. Replace `<ScopeName>` with the adaptive scope name and `<PolicyName>` with the associated policy.

### 1.1 Scope Configuration & Filter Query

```powershell
Get-AdaptiveScope "<ScopeName>" | FL Name, LocationType, FilterQuery, WhenCreated, WhenChanged
```

### 1.2 User Scope OPATH Validation

```powershell
# Test the scope filter query against actual recipients
Get-Recipient -Filter "<same filter from adaptive scope>" -ResultSize Unlimited | Measure-Object
Get-Recipient -Filter "<same filter from adaptive scope>" -ResultSize 10 | FL Name, RecipientType, RecipientTypeDetails
```

### 1.3 M365 Group Scope Validation

```powershell
# For group-type adaptive scopes
Get-Mailbox -GroupMailbox -Filter "<same filter from adaptive scope>" -ResultSize Unlimited | Measure-Object
```

### 1.4 Associated Retention Policy Status

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" | FL Name, Enabled, Mode, DistributionStatus, AdaptiveScopeLocation
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" -DistributionDetail | FL DistributionDetail
```

### 1.5 Non-Mailbox User Inflation Check

```powershell
# Compare Get-User (all users) vs Get-Recipient (mailbox users) for the same filter
Get-User -Filter "<same filter from adaptive scope>" -ResultSize Unlimited | Measure-Object
Get-Recipient -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox -Filter "<same filter from adaptive scope>" -ResultSize Unlimited | Measure-Object
```

### 1.6 Scope Age Check

```powershell
Get-AdaptiveScope "<ScopeName>" | FL WhenCreated
# Calculate days since creation — scope needs at least 5 days to fully populate
```

### 1.7 Scope Membership

> **NOTE:** `Get-AdaptiveScopeMembers` is not available via the MCP tool. This command must be executed manually by the admin in a PowerShell session.

```powershell
Get-AdaptiveScopeMembers -Identity "<ScopeName>"
```

## Diagnostic Analysis

Analyze the collected data against the following criteria. Flag each as ✅ (healthy) or ❌ (issue found).

**OPATH operators reference:** `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `like`, `notlike`, `and`, `or`, `not`

**KQL site template reference:**

| Template | Site Type |
|---|---|
| `SITEPAGEPUBLISHING` | Modern communication sites |
| `GROUP` | Microsoft 365 group-connected sites |
| `TEAMCHANNEL` | Teams private channel sites |
| `STS` | Classic SharePoint team sites |
| `SPSPERS` | OneDrive sites |

**Adaptive scope limits:**

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| String length for attribute values | 200 chars |
| Attributes per group or without group | 10 |
| Number of groups | 10 |
| Advanced query characters | 10,000 |
| Members displayed in scope details | 1,000,000 |
| Simulation locations (adaptive scope) | 20,000 |

| # | Check | Condition for ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Scope populated** | `Get-AdaptiveScopeMembers` returns no results or `Get-Recipient -Filter` returns no matches |
| 2 | **Scope age ≥ 5 days** | `WhenCreated` < 5 days ago — scope has not had time to fully populate |
| 3 | **OPATH syntax valid** | `Get-Recipient -Filter` returns an error — filter query has syntax issues (unbalanced quotes, wrong operators, invalid attributes) |
| 4 | **Non-mailbox user inflation** | `Get-User` count significantly exceeds `Get-Recipient` count — unlicensed/synced accounts without mailboxes are inflating the scope |
| 5 | **Arbitration mailbox inclusion** | Scope details in portal show system/arbitration mailboxes — these appear in scope details but not in PowerShell validation. Expected behavior |
| 6 | **KQL site template mapping** | For SharePoint scopes, KQL query uses incorrect template name or custom `RefinableString` properties are not mapped correctly |
| 7 | **Policy distribution** | `DistributionStatus` ≠ Success on the associated policy → switch to [policy-stuck-error.md](policy-stuck-error.md) |
| 8 | **Trainable classifier + adaptive scope** | Auto-apply policy uses a trainable classifier AND an adaptive scope — this combination is **not supported**. Use a static scope instead |
| 9 | **Attribute limits exceeded** | Filter query uses more than 10 attributes per group, or more than 10 groups |
| 10 | **Query length exceeded** | Advanced query exceeds 10,000 characters |
| 11 | **Simulation location limit** | Simulation mode with adaptive scope exceeds 20,000 locations |
| 12 | **Membership display limit** | Scope has more than 1,000,000 members — portal display truncated (not an error, but affects verification) |

## Resolution & Remediation

Based on flagged issues from the diagnostic analysis, apply the corresponding resolution:

| ❌ Check | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Filter query returns no matches | Review and correct the `FilterQuery` — validate with `Get-Recipient -Filter` or `Get-Mailbox -GroupMailbox -Filter` before updating the scope |
| 2 | Scope too new to populate | Wait at least 5 days after scope creation. Do not assign to a policy until membership is confirmed |
| 3 | OPATH syntax error | Fix filter syntax — check for unbalanced quotes, incorrect operators, or invalid attribute names. See OPATH operators reference above |
| 4 | Unlicensed users inflating count | Refine the filter to target only mailbox-enabled recipients: add `(RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox')` or `(RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'UserMailbox')` to the filter |
| 5 | Arbitration mailboxes in scope details | No action required — this is expected behavior. Arbitration mailboxes are excluded from policy enforcement |
| 6 | Incorrect KQL site template | Correct the KQL query using the site template reference above. Validate by running the query in SharePoint search before applying |
| 7 | Policy distribution failure | Switch to [policy-stuck-error.md](policy-stuck-error.md) for distribution troubleshooting |
| 8 | Trainable classifier + adaptive scope | Remove the adaptive scope and use a static scope instead. This is a platform limitation — see [auto-apply-labels.md](auto-apply-labels.md) |
| 9 | Too many attributes in filter | Simplify the filter to stay within the 10-attribute limit per group |
| 10 | Query too long | Shorten the advanced query to under 10,000 characters |
| 11 | Too many simulation locations | Reduce adaptive scope membership below 20,000 before running simulation, or run simulation in batches |
| 12 | Membership display truncated | Use `Get-AdaptiveScopeMembers` in PowerShell to view full membership beyond 1,000,000 |
