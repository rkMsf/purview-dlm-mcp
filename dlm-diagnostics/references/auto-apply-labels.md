# Auto-Apply Retention Labels Not Working

## Symptoms

- **Content not being labeled:** Auto-apply policy is enabled and distributed, but target content does not receive the expected retention label.
- **Content already labeled — auto-apply skips:** Target items already have a retention label applied (manually, via default label, or another auto-apply policy) — auto-apply **never overwrites** existing labels.
- **Stuck in simulation mode:** Policy remains in Simulate mode and is not actively labeling content. Admin may have forgotten to switch to Enable.
- **Policy shows "Off (Error)":** Auto-apply policy status displays "Off (Error)" in the Purview portal — distribution failed.
- **Trainable classifier not labeling old content:** Classifier-based auto-apply policy only evaluates content created within the last 6 months (180 days) — older content is skipped.
- **SIT-based policy not labeling existing Exchange mail:** Sensitive info type auto-apply for Exchange only processes newly sent/received mail — items already stored in mailboxes are not evaluated.
- **Custom SIT not labeling existing SharePoint/OneDrive content:** Custom sensitive info types can only auto-label new or modified content in SP/OD, not already-stored items.

## Data Collection

Execute all commands below to gather the complete diagnostic dataset. Replace `<PolicyName>` with the auto-apply policy name.

### 1.1 Policy Status & Type

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" | FL Name, Guid, Enabled, Mode, Type, DistributionStatus, WhenCreated, WhenChanged
```

### 1.2 Distribution Detail

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" -DistributionDetail | FL DistributionDetail
```

### 1.3 Auto-Apply Rule Configuration

```powershell
Get-RetentionComplianceRule -Policy "<PolicyName>" | FL Name, ContentMatchQuery, ContentContainsSensitiveInformation, RetentionComplianceAction, RetentionDuration, PublishComplianceTag, Mode
```

### 1.4 Linked Retention Label

```powershell
Get-ComplianceTag | FL Name, Guid, RetentionDuration, RetentionAction, IsRecordLabel
```

### 1.5 Policy Scope (Workload Locations & Adaptive Scope)

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" | FL ExchangeLocation, ExchangeLocationException, SharePointLocation, SharePointLocationException, OneDriveLocation, OneDriveLocationException, AdaptiveScopeLocation
```

### 1.6 Adaptive Scope Validation (If Applicable)

```powershell
# Only if AdaptiveScopeLocation is populated
Get-AdaptiveScope "<ScopeName>" | FL Name, LocationType, FilterQuery, WhenCreated
Get-Recipient -Filter "<same filter from adaptive scope>" -ResultSize 10 | FL Name, RecipientType
```

### 1.7 Count of All Auto-Apply Policies (Limit Check)

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy | Where-Object {$_.Type -eq "ApplyTag"} | Measure-Object
```

### 1.8 Retention Label Details

> **NOTE:** `Get-Label` is not available via the MCP tool. This command must be executed manually by the admin in a PowerShell session.

```powershell
Get-Label | Format-Table DisplayName, Name, Guid, ContentType
```

## Diagnostic Analysis

Analyze the collected data against the following criteria. Flag each as ✅ (healthy) or ❌ (issue found).

**Key auto-apply behavior rules:**
- Auto-apply labels **never overwrite** an existing retention label on content.
- Auto-apply policies can take **up to 7 days** to start labeling after creation or enablement.
- Trainable classifiers can only evaluate content created within the **last 6 months** (180 days).

| # | Check | Condition for ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Policy enabled** | `Enabled` = False |
| 2 | **Distribution status / "Off (Error)"** | `DistributionStatus` ≠ Success or portal shows "Off (Error)" → retry distribution, then see [policy-stuck-error.md](policy-stuck-error.md) if still failing |
| 3 | **Simulation mode** | `Mode` = Simulate — policy is not applying labels, only simulating. Switch to Enable when ready |
| 4 | **Matching criteria configured** | `ContentMatchQuery` is empty AND no SIT/classifier configured — no matching criteria set on the rule |
| 5 | **Label linked to rule** | `PublishComplianceTag` is empty — no retention label is linked to the auto-apply rule |
| 6 | **Existing labels blocking** | Target content already has a retention label applied (including default labels) — auto-apply will skip these items |
| 7 | **Trainable classifier + content age** | Policy uses a trainable classifier and target content is older than 6 months — classifier cannot evaluate old content |
| 8 | **Trainable classifier + adaptive scope** | Policy uses a trainable classifier AND an adaptive scope — this combination is **not supported**. Use a static scope instead |
| 9 | **Custom SIT + existing SP/OD content** | Policy uses a custom sensitive info type targeting existing SharePoint/OneDrive content — custom SITs can only auto-label new/modified content, not already-stored items |
| 10 | **Exchange SIT scope** | SIT-based auto-apply for Exchange applies only to sent/received mail — not to items already stored in mailboxes |
| 11 | **Processing time** | Policy created or enabled within the last 7 days — auto-apply is still within normal processing window |
| 12 | **KQL query validity** | `ContentMatchQuery` contains invalid KQL syntax — test the query in Content Search to verify matches |
| 13 | **Policy limit** | Total auto-apply policies exceed tenant limits (10,000 total policies across all types) |
| 14 | **Simulation location limit** | Simulation mode with adaptive scope exceeds 20,000 locations |
| 15 | **Adaptive scope population** | Associated adaptive scope has 0 members or was created < 5 days ago → see [adaptive-scope.md](adaptive-scope.md) |

## Resolution & Remediation

Based on flagged issues from the diagnostic analysis, apply the corresponding resolution:

| ❌ Check | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Policy disabled | Enable the policy: `Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" -Enabled $true` |
| 2 | Distribution failure / "Off (Error)" | Retry: `Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" -RetryDistribution` — wait 24–48 hrs. If still failing → [policy-stuck-error.md](policy-stuck-error.md) |
| 3 | Policy in simulation mode | Switch to enforce: `Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy "<PolicyName>" -Mode Enable` — review simulation results first |
| 4 | No matching criteria | Add a content match query, SIT, or classifier to the auto-apply rule |
| 5 | No label linked | Link a retention label to the rule via the Purview portal or PowerShell |
| 6 | Content already labeled | Auto-apply never overwrites — remove existing labels first (manually or via script) if auto-apply should take priority |
| 7 | Classifier cannot evaluate old content | Trainable classifiers only work on content < 6 months old. For older content, use KQL keyword queries or SITs instead |
| 8 | Trainable classifier + adaptive scope | Remove the adaptive scope and use a static scope instead — see [adaptive-scope.md](adaptive-scope.md) |
| 9 | Custom SIT limitation for existing content | Custom SITs only auto-label new or modified content in SP/OD. Modify existing items to trigger re-evaluation, or use a built-in SIT |
| 10 | SIT limited to new Exchange mail | SIT-based auto-apply for Exchange only processes sent/received mail. Use Content Search to label existing items |
| 11 | Normal processing delay | Wait up to 7 days for auto-apply to begin processing. Re-check after 7 days |
| 12 | Invalid KQL query | Fix KQL syntax — test the query in Purview Content Search before applying. Ensure content is indexed |
| 13 | Policy limit reached | Consolidate existing policies to stay within tenant limits |
| 14 | Simulation location limit exceeded | Reduce adaptive scope membership below 20,000 before running simulation |
| 15 | Adaptive scope not populated | Wait at least 5 days for scope population → see [adaptive-scope.md](adaptive-scope.md) for full troubleshooting |
