# Items Stuck in SubstrateHolds / Recoverable Items Quota Exceeded

## Symptoms

- **Recoverable Items folder growing uncontrollably:** RI folder size steadily increasing despite no user action — retained content (Teams, Copilot, Viva Engage) accumulating in SubstrateHolds.
- **Items stuck in SubstrateHolds:** Items remain in the hidden `SubstrateHolds` folder beyond the configured retention period + 7-day cleanup window — competing holds preventing purge.
- **User unable to send/receive email:** Mailbox quota exceeded due to RI folder consuming the mailbox's total storage allocation.
- **"Mailbox is full" or quota warning:** User receives quota warnings even though their visible mailbox has free space — RI folder is consuming quota behind the scenes.
- **MFA not processing mailbox:** Managed Folder Assistant cannot run because the RI quota is exhausted — retention tags not being applied to visible folders.

## Background: Recoverable Items Architecture

The Recoverable Items (RI) folder contains hidden subfolders that store retained and deleted content:

| Subfolder | Purpose | Default Quota |
|---|---|---|
| **Deletions** | Items deleted by user (soft-delete) | Part of RI quota |
| **Purges** | Items purged from Deletions (hard-delete) | Part of RI quota |
| **DiscoveryHolds** | Items retained by eDiscovery holds | Part of RI quota |
| **SubstrateHolds** | Teams messages, Copilot interactions, Viva Engage content retained by Purview | Part of RI quota |
| **Versions** | Original copies of modified items (copy-on-write for holds) | Part of RI quota |

**Default quotas:** RI quota = 30 GB (E3/E5), 100 GB (with holds/auto-expanding). Warning at 20 GB / 90 GB respectively.

## Data Collection

Execute all commands below to gather the complete diagnostic dataset. Replace `<UPN>` with the affected user's email address.

### 1.1 Recoverable Items Folder Statistics

```powershell
Get-MailboxFolderStatistics <UPN> -FolderScope RecoverableItems | FL Name, FolderSize, ItemsInFolder, FolderPath
```

### 1.2 All Holds on Mailbox

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <UPN> | FL InPlaceHolds, LitigationHoldEnabled, LitigationHoldDuration, LitigationHoldDate, LitigationHoldOwner, ComplianceTagHoldApplied, DelayHoldApplied, DelayReleaseHoldApplied, RetentionHoldEnabled, StartDateForRetentionHold, EndDateForRetentionHold
```

### 1.3 Org-Level Holds

```powershell
(Get-OrganizationConfig).InPlaceHolds
```

### 1.4 Retention Policies Targeting Mailbox

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy | Where-Object {$_.ExchangeLocation -eq "All" -or $_.ExchangeLocation -contains "<UPN>"} | FL Name, RetentionDuration
```

### 1.5 Dumpster Expiration Status

```powershell
$logs = Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs <UPN> -ExtendedProperties
$xmlprops = [xml]($logs.MailboxLog)
$xmlprops.Properties.MailboxTable.Property | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "DumpsterExpirationLastSuccessRunTimestamp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value
```

```powershell
(Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs <UPN> -ComponentName DumpsterExpiration).MailboxLog
```

### 1.6 Archive Dumpster Expiration (If Archive Exists)

```powershell
$archiveGuid = (Get-Mailbox <UPN>).ArchiveGuid
$archiveLogs = Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs $archiveGuid -ExtendedProperties
$archiveXml = [xml]($archiveLogs.MailboxLog)
$archiveXml.Properties.MailboxTable.Property | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "DumpsterExpirationLastSuccessRunTimestamp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value
```

### 1.7 Primary & Archive Quota Utilization

```powershell
$mbx = Get-Mailbox <UPN>
$stats = Get-MailboxStatistics <UPN>

Write-Host "Primary — TotalItemSize: $($stats.TotalItemSize) / ProhibitSendReceiveQuota: $($mbx.ProhibitSendReceiveQuota)"
Write-Host "Primary — TotalDeletedItemSize: $($stats.TotalDeletedItemSize) / RecoverableItemsQuota: $($mbx.RecoverableItemsQuota)"
```

## Diagnostic Analysis

Analyze the collected data against the following criteria. Flag each as ✅ (healthy) or ❌ (issue found).

**Hold GUID prefixes:** `mbx` = Purview retention (Exchange), `cld` = Purview retention (modern group), `UniH` = eDiscovery case hold, `skp` = SharePoint/OneDrive retention.

**Note:** `RetentionHoldEnabled` suspends expiration at **IPM level only** (visible folders — both deletions and archival). It has **no impact** on Dumpster/Recoverable Items expiration.

| # | Check | Condition for ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Dominant RI folder** | `SubstrateHolds` is largest → Teams/Copilot/Viva content retained. `DiscoveryHolds`/`Purges` largest → eDiscovery or Purview hold content |
| 2 | **Litigation hold** | `LitigationHoldEnabled` = True → ALL items retained indefinitely in RI |
| 3 | **Delay hold** | `DelayHoldApplied` = True → 30-day delay from recently removed hold |
| 4 | **Delay release hold** | `DelayReleaseHoldApplied` = True → additional delay hold variant active |
| 5 | **Org-level holds** | `InPlaceHolds` from `Get-OrganizationConfig` contains entries |
| 6 | **Multiple overlapping holds** | Multiple holds with different retention periods — longest wins; all must expire before cleanup |
| 7 | **SubstrateHolds retention expired** | Items in SubstrateHolds beyond retention period + 7 days (TBA cleanup runs every 3–7 days) |
| 8 | **Dumpster expiration** | `DumpsterExpirationLastSuccessRunTimestamp` not found or > 7 days old |
| 9 | **RI quota** | `TotalDeletedItemSize` within 5 GB of `RecoverableItemsQuota` |
| 10 | **Primary quota** | `TotalItemSize` within 5 GB of `ProhibitSendReceiveQuota` |
| 11 | **ComplianceTagHoldApplied** | `ComplianceTagHoldApplied` = True — a retention label with "retain" action is preserving items in Recoverable Items, preventing cleanup even after policy removal |

## Resolution & Remediation

Based on flagged issues from the diagnostic report, apply the corresponding resolution:

| ❌ Check | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (SubstrateHolds, within retention) | Items retained per policy — by design | No action needed |
| 2 | Litigation hold retaining all RI content | Remove if no longer needed; if needed, quota increase is the only relief |
| 3 | Delay hold from recently removed policy | Wait 30 days for auto-expiry, or: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -RemoveDelayHoldApplied` |
| 4 | Additional delay hold variant | Wait for auto-expiry or **escalate** if persisting |
| 5 | Org-wide holds retaining RI content | Review org-level holds; remove if no longer required |
| 6 | Multiple overlapping holds | All holds must expire before cleanup — remove unnecessary holds |
| 7 | TBA cleanup stuck | **Escalate** — Timer-Based Assistant not processing SubstrateHolds |
| 8 | Dumpster expiration not running | Review DumpsterExpiration logs; **escalate** if stuck > 7 days |
| 9 | RI quota nearly exhausted | Temporary relief: `Set-Mailbox <UPN> -RecoverableItemsQuota 100GB -RecoverableItemsWarningQuota 90GB` — address underlying hold/retention config |
| 10 | Primary mailbox quota exhausted | Address RI bloat first (above); primary quota relief is secondary |
