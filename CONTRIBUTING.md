## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rkMsf/purview-dlm-mcp.git
   cd purview-dlm-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Running Tests

Tests require an Exchange Online environment. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DLM_UPN=admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
export DLM_ORGANIZATION=yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
```

Then run:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs both the E2E tests (30 tests) and the TSG diagnostics tests (44 tests). Tests use interactive MSAL authentication — a browser window will open for sign-in on first run.
